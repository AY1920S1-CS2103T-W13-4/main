== Introduction

Budget Buddy is an all-in-one expense tracking application for computing students who prefer to use a desktop app
to manage their expenses. More importantly, Budget Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command
Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you type fast, Budget Buddy can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Furthermore, Budget Buddy allows computing students to add their own functions through customized JavaScript files,
as well as a set of rules to simplify expense tracking through automation.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation of the current as well as upcoming features, including the setup
process, as well as some commonly asked questions. For the hands-on person, check out the _Quick Start_ section right
below.

// end::accounts[]

// tag::loans[]
=== Managing loans: `loan`

This feature enables you to keep track of who owes you money - and exactly how much they owe you.
Never again allow those small sums you lend out to accumulate into a massive pile of forgotten gold.
You can also record who you owe money to, saving you the embarrassment of being publicly reminded by your loan shark friends.
Finally, it can even help you calculate who owes who how much
when you and said friends wake in the morning after an expensive night out.

==== Add a new loan: `loan out|in`

Adds a new loan out/in entry.
If a date is not given, it is set to the current date. The description is also optional.

Format: `loan out|in p/<person> x/<amount> [w/<date>] [d/<description>]`

Examples:

* `loan out p/John Doe x/50 w/23/04/2018`
* `loan in p/Jane Doe x/100 d/Lent me some money for booze.`

==== List loans: `loan list`

Displays a list of all loans. Optionally, filters and/or sorts the list.

Format: `loan list [out|in|unpaid|paid ...] [p/<person> ...] [x/<amount> ...] [w/<date> ...] [d/<description> ...] [s/w|x|p]`
****
* Filter loans using one or two of the `out`, `in`, `unpaid`, `paid` filters.
If two are used, they should not be duplicates.
Contrasting filters can be used (e.g. `out in`) but they will be joined with logical `AND`,
so the resulting list would be empty.
* Filter loans by persons, amounts, dates and descriptions
by adding one or more of the `p/<person>`, `x/<amount>`, `w/<date>`, `d/<description>` filters.
* If more than one filter is used, filters will be joined using logical `AND`.
For example, `loan list out p/Duke` will result in the filter: `loans out AND loans with Duke`.
* Sort loans by date, amount, or persons' names using `s/w`, `s/x`, or `s/p` respectively.
** Sorting the list using the same method when it is already sorted will reverse the order of sorting
(e.g. newest date first to oldest date first).
****

[NOTE]
Adding a new loan to the list will reset all filters. Other list operations (edit, paid/unpaid, delete) will not.

Examples:

* `loan list out unpaid p/John Doe` +
Lists all unpaid loans out to the person named "John Doe".
* `loan list s/p` +
`loan list s/p` +
Lists all loans sorted by persons in alphabetical order. Then lists all loans again, but sorted by persons in reverse alphabetical order.

==== Edit loan: `loan edit`

Edits the specified field(s) of the loan entry with the specified index.

Format: `loan edit <index> [<p/person>] [x/<amount>] [d/<description>] [w/<date>]`

****
* Edits the loan with the specified index.
The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed loan list.
The index must be a positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3...).
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `loan list` +
`loan edit 1 x/500 d/Dude owes me so much money I can't even.` +
Lists all loans, then edits the amount and description of the first person in the list to the given values.

==== Mark loan(s) as paid: `loan paid`

Marks the specified loan(s) as paid.

Format: `loan paid [<index ...>] [<p/person ...>]`

****
* If a person's name is specified, all their loans are marked as paid.
* At least one index or person must be specified.
* Marking an already paid loan will re-mark the loan as paid (to no visible effect).
* If multiple indices and/or persons are targeted but an index or person cannot be found in the currently displayed list,
the indices and/or persons that can be found will still be marked.
****

Examples:

* `loan list` +
`loan paid 1 2 3` +
Lists all loans, then marks the first three loans in the list as *paid*.
* `loan paid p/John p/Adam` +
Marks all loans pertaining to John and Adam as *paid*.

==== Mark loan(s) as unpaid: `loan unpaid`

Marks the specified loan(s) as unpaid.
This feature works identically to `loan paid`, except the command word is `unpaid` instead of `paid`
and the loans are marked as *unpaid* instead of *paid*.

Format: `loan unpaid [<index ...>] [<p/person ...>]`

==== Delete loan(s): `loan delete`

Deletes the loan(s) with the specified loan index/indices.
This feature works identically to `loan paid`, except the command word is `delete` instead of `paid`
and the loans are deleted from the list instead of being marked.

Format: `loan delete [<index ...>] [<p/person ...>]`

==== Calculate loans: `loan split`

Splits a joint payment equally among group members, then displays a list of who owes who how much.

Format: `loan split p/<person> x/<amount paid> [max/<limit>] ... [me/<your name> w/<date> d/<description>]`
****
* Each `<person>` corresponds to an `<amount paid>`, representing how much the `person` paid for the group initially. +
The order of each `person` should match the order of their `amount paid`.
* The final amount a `person` ends up paying can be restricted to a `<limit>`.
Persons with limits should be placed at the *head* of the list of persons,
and the order of all `limits` should match the order of `persons` (as with `amount paid`).
This is to allow you to enter limits only for those persons who require them.
+
The sum of all limits cannot exceed the total amount already paid by all persons.
* Adding the optional `me/` will add all debts from the resulting list to your loan list.
+
`<your name>` must match one of the persons among the other `p/<person>` names.
* Adding `w/` will set the `<date>` of the loans added to your list.
* Adding `d/` will set the `<description>` of the loans added to your list.
* To switch between your loan list and split list, press `Ctrl + D` (or `Cmd + D` for Mac) while on the Loans tab.
** The split list will initially be empty,
but once a list is calculated it will persist in the Loans tab across sessions (until a new calculation is made).
****

Examples:

* `loan split p/John x/0 p/Mary x/40 p/Peter x/60` +
Calculates the money owed between `John`, `Mary` and `Peter` for a scenario where (initially) `Mary` paid `40` and `Peter` paid `60`. +
The resulting display should show that `John` owes `Mary` *$6.66* and also owes `Peter` *$26.67*.
* `loan split p/John x/0 max/10 p/Mary x/10 p/Peter x/90 me/Mary d/Dinner.` +
In this scenario, `Mary` paid `10` and `Peter` paid `90`.
`max/10` restricts the final amount `John` pays/owes to `10`, despite the total amount being `0 + 10 + 90 = 100`.
Furthermore, `me/Mary` marks `Mary` as the user (you),
so any debts `Mary` owes/is owed will be added to the normal loan list with the description `Dinner.`. +
The resulting display should show that `John` owes `Peter` *$10* and `You` owe `Peter` *$35*.
The latter debt will also have been added to your loan list,
which can be checked using the command `loan list` or by pressing the hotkey mentioned above.
// end::loans[]

// tag::rules[]
=== Automating with rules: `rule`

*Introducing the _Rule Engine_.*
A way for you to automate certain actions based on a certain predicate.
Spend less time typing repetitive commands, and spend more time keeping track of your expenses!

Rules have the following structure: If "predicate" is true, then perform "action". By creating a
predicate which defines the condition you set, you can perform any action you create whenever a
transaction is added/edited, if the transaction satisfies that condition.

All rules in the Rule Engine will be executed on a transaction, when:

* it is a new transaction and has been successfully added into an account.

OR

* it is an existing transaction and has been successfully edited.

WARNING: All rules will be executed from the top of the list downwards.
Typically, this is the order in which the rules were added.
Rules with conflicting actions will therefore be allowed.

==== Add a new rule: `rule add`

Adds a new rule to the rule engine.
Both the predicate and action have to be specified.
A rule can be formed using either expressions or scripts, or both.

Format: `rule add p/<expression | script name> a/<expression | script name>`

NOTE: Note that scripts used in rules are not validated; make sure they are free from error.
Predicate scripts that do not return a boolean _will be executed_, but will therefore implicitly return false.
Action scripts will be executed if the predicate returns true, and any return value will be discarded.

****
*Expression Formatting Guide:*

* **Predicate**: In the order of `<attribute> <predicate operator> <value>`
** An attribute can be one of the following:
*** `inamt` : Transaction amount inwards
*** `outamt` : Transaction amount outwards
*** `desc` : Transaction description
*** `date` : Transaction date
** A predicate operator can be one of the following:
*** `=` : Equality comparison operator
*** `<` , `\<=`  , `>=` , `>` : Inequality comparison operators
*** `contains` : Substring check operator (Cannot be used on dates)
** A value can be a number or a string of length not more than 180 characters
It can contain the following special characters: +
!#$%&'*+=?`+_+/[{|}]~^.-

* **Action**: In the order of `<action operator> [<value>]`
** An action operator can be one of the following:
*** `set_cat` : Adds a category to the transaction
*** `remove_cat` : Removes a category from the transaction
*** `set_desc` : Sets the description of the transaction
*** `app_desc` : Appends a value to the description
*** `prep_desc` : Prepends a value to the description
*** `set_in` : Sets the direction of the transaction to be inwards
*** `set_out` : Sets the direction of the transaction to be outwards
*** `switch_direct` : Switches the current direction of the transaction
** A value is as described in a predicate expression,
and is not required for `set_in`, `set_out` and `switch_direct`

*Script Usage in Rules:*

* Scripts used in rules have access to two additional arguments:
** The transaction to test/act upon is stored in "_argv[0]_"
** The account that the transaction belongs to is stored in "_argv[1]_"
* Refer to <<Scripting>> for general script usage.
****

Examples:

* `rule add pred/outamt >= 100 act/prep_desc [Large Spending]` +
Adds a new rule that specifies that if an outward transaction has an amount more
or equal to $100, prepend the transaction's description with "[Large Spending]".

* `rule add pred/desc contains food act/set_cat Food` +
Adds a new rule that specifies that if a transaction description contains "food",
add the category "Food" to that transaction.

* `rule add pred/desc = m act/set_desc Monthly Allowance` +
Adds a new rule that specifies that if a transaction description is exactly "m",
change its description to "Monthly Allowance".

==== List rules: `rule list`

Displays the list of all existing rules in the Rule Engine.
Rules are sorted by the order in which they were added.

Format: `rule list`

==== Edit a rule: `rule edit`

Edits the specified fields in the rule with the specified ID.
Both the predicate and action can be modified.

Format: `rule edit <rule ID> [p/<expression | script>] [a/<expression | script>]`

Examples:

* `rule edit 1 pred/inamt \<= 10` +
Edits the predicate of the first rule in the list to check if an
inward transaction has an amount less than or equal to 10.

* `rule edit 4 act/set_in` +
Edits the action of the 4th rule in the list to set the direction of
a transaction to be inwards.

==== Delete a rule: `rule delete`

Deletes a rule with the specified rule ID.

Format: `rule delete <rule ID>`

Examples:

* `rule delete 5` +
Deletes the 5th rule in the list.

==== Swap two rules: `rule swap`

NOTE: Ths will affect the execution order of the rules.
Rules will be executed from the top of the list downwards.

Swaps the position of two specified rules in the Rule Engine.

Format: `rule swap <rule 1 ID> <rule 2 ID>

Examples:

* `rule swap 2 4` +
Swaps the ordering of the 2nd rule and the 4th rule.
// end::rules[]

// tag::scripting[]
[[Scripting]]
=== Scripting: `script`

The scripting engine allows you to evaluate arbitrary scripts to perform complex operations on your transaction data,
as well as extend the application and add commands and features of your own.

WARNING: Scripts have full access to the application's internals, as well as all Java standard library classes and APIs.
It is possible to corrupt the application state by execution of a malicious or buggy script. There are no guarantees on
application behaviour if scripts are used.

==== Evaluate a script: `script eval`

Evaluates a script and displays the result.

Format: `script eval <script>`

****
* The scripting language is JavaScript (specifically, ECMAScript 5.1).
****

==== Add a stored script: `script add`

Stores a script for future invocation.

Format: `script add <script name> [p/<file path> | s/<script>]`

****
* The script name may contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes.
* If neither a file path nor the script code is given, a file browser is opened for you to
select the script file.
****

WARNING: The script is not checked for correctness before it is stored. Any syntax errors
will be reported only when the script is run.

==== Delete a stored script: `script delete`

Deletes a previously-stored script.

Format: `script delete <script name>`

==== Run a stored script: `script run`

Runs a previously-stored script.

Format: `script run <script name> [<argument>]`

****
* The argument is the rest of the command line after the script name, and is passed to the script as a single string.
****

==== List stored scripts: `script list`

Lists stored scripts.

Format: `script list`

==== Reset the scripting environment: `script reset`

=== Aliases *(Coming in v1.4)* : `alias`

==== Add an alias: `alias add`

Adds an alias.

Format: `alias add <alias name> c/<alias replacement>`

****
* When executed, the alias name will be replaced by the replacement, and the resulting command line executed.
** For example, suppose you add an alias named `abcd efgh 7890`, with replacement `script run x`.
** Executing `abcd efgh 7890 abcd` is equivalent to executing `script run x abcd`.
* The alias name must appear at the start of a command line, followed by a space, for it to be recognised.
* There is no restriction on the characters in the alias name. However, leading and trailing whitespace will be trimmed.
* Aliases can expand to other aliases.
****

WARNING: Built-in commands take precedence. If you add an alias with the same name as a built-in command, it will have no effect.

==== Delete an alias: `alias delete`

Deletes an alias.
