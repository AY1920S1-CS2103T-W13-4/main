== Introduction

Budget Buddy is for computing students who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their expenses.
More importantly, Budget Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Budget Buddy can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Furthermore, Budget Buddy allows computing students to add their own functions through customized JavaScript files,
as well as a set of rules to simplify expense tracking through automation.

identical entries will be added either daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
****

If the ‘recurring’ field is modified, the app will ask if all previous recurring entries should be deleted.

If no period is specified, it defaults to the current month-to-date.
* You can see a total report that shows your total income and expenditure and budget information,
if a budget has been set up,  or a report that breaks your income and expenditure down into categories.
If the type is omitted, it defaults to a total report.

****

=== Managing budgets: `budget`

****
* If the account is omitted, the default account is set.

****
* Adding a person's name filters the list to that/those person(s)'s loans only.
* Adding ‘o’ argument filters list to out loans only.
* Adding ‘i’ argument filters list to in loans only.
* Add `s/w` to sort the list by date, `s/x` to sort by amount, or `s/p` to sort by person.
** Adding `s/x` when the list is already sorted by amount will reverse the order of sorting (e.g. descending to ascending). This works for all available sorts.
