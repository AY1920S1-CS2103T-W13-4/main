== Introduction

Budget Buddy is an all-in-one expense tracking application for computing students who prefer to use a desktop app
to manage their expenses. More importantly, Budget Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command
Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you type fast, Budget Buddy can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Furthermore, Budget Buddy allows computing students to add their own functions through customized JavaScript files,
as well as a set of rules to simplify expense tracking through automation.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation of the current as well as upcoming features, including the setup
process, as well as some commonly asked questions. For the hands-on person, check out the _Quick Start_ section right
below.

== Quick Start

Welcome to the Budget Buddy User Guide! You can scroll down to start looking at the in-depth features of Budget Buddy,
or select a topic from the _Table of Contents_ above.

[[Features]]
== Features

Budget Buddy comes with many tools to help you manage your expenses better! You can create multiple accounts,
add and remove transactions that you have made, and even track any outstanding loans that you may have.

What's more? Automate processes by using rules. Typing repetitive descriptions? Set the description of a transaction
automatically by using a keyword! Set a Food category automatically each time you make a food
transaction! Automate everything!

If you know how to code in JavaScript, great news for you too. Write and evaluate your own scripts within the application,
do complicated things in a snap. And even use your script in rules!

// tag::loans[]
=== Tracking loans: `loan`

==== Add a new loan: `loan out|in`

Adds a new loan out/in entry.
Each loan has a unique ID.
If a date is not given, it is set to the current date. The description is also optional.

Format: `loan out|in p/<person> x/<amount> [w/<date>] [d/<description>]`

Examples:

* `loan out p/John Doe x/50 w/23/04/2018`
* `loan in p/Jane Doe x/100 d/Lent me some money for booze.`

==== List loans: `loan list`

Displays a list of all loans. Optionally, filters and/or sorts the list.

Format: `loan list [out|in|unpaid|paid ...] [p/<person> ...] [x/<amount> ...] [w/<date> ...] [d/<description> ...] [s/w|x|p]`
****
* Filter loans using one or more of the `out`, `in`, `unpaid`, `paid` filters.
* Filter loans persons, amounts, dates and descriptions by adding one or more of the `p/<person>`, `x/<amount>`, `w/<date>`, `d/<description>` filters.
* If more than one filter is used, filters will be joined using logical `AND`.
For example, `loan list out p/Duke` will result in the filter: `loans out AND loans with Duke`.
* Sort loans by date, amount, or persons' names using `s/w`, `s/x`, or `s/p` respectively.
** Sorting the list using the same method when it is already sorted will reverse the order of sorting (e.g. descending to ascending).
****

[NOTE]
Adding a new loan to the list will reset all filters. Other list operations (edit, paid/unpaid, delete) will not.

Examples:

* `loan list out unpaid p/John Doe` +
Lists all unpaid loans out to the person named "John Doe".
* `loan list s/p` +
`loan list s/p` +
Lists all loans sorted by persons in alphabetical order. Then lists all loans again, but sorted by persons in reverse alphabetical order.

==== Edit loan: `loan edit`

Edits the specified field of the loan entry with the specified index.

Format: `loan edit <index> [<p/person>] [x/<amount>] [d/<description>] [w/<date>]`

****
* Edits the loan with the specified index. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed loan list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `loan list` +
`loan edit 1 x/500 d/Dude owes me so much money I can't even.` +
Lists all loans, then edits the amount and description of the first person in the list to the given values.

==== Mark loan(s) as paid: `loan paid`

Marks the specified loan(s) as paid.
If a person's name is specified, all their loans are also marked as paid.

Format: `loan paid <index ...> [<p/person ...>]`

Examples:

* `loan list` +
`loan paid 1 2 3` +
Lists all loans, then marks the first three loans in the list as *paid*.
* `loan paid p/John p/Adam` +
Marks all loans in from and out to John and Adam as *paid*.

==== Mark loan(s) as unpaid: `loan unpaid`

Marks the specified loan(s) as unpaid.
If a person's name is specified, all their loans are marked as unpaid.
This feature works identically to `loan paid`, except the command word is `unpaid` instead of `paid`.

Format: `loan unpaid <index ...> <p/person ...>`

==== Delete loan(s): `loan delete`

Deletes the loan(s) with the specified loan index/indices.
If a person's name is specified, all of that person's loans are deleted.

Format: `loan delete <index ...> <p/person ...>`

Example:

* `loan list` +
`loan delete 1` +
Lists all loans, then deletes the first loan in the list.
* `loan delete p/John` +
Deletes all loans in from and out to John.

==== Calculate loans: `loan split`

Splits a joint payment equally among group members, then displays a list of who owes who how much.

Format: `loan split p/<person> x/<amount paid> [max/<limit>] ... [me/<your name> w/<date> d/<description>]`
****
* Each `<person>` corresponds to an `<amount paid>`, representing how much the `person` paid for the group initially. +
The order of each `person` should match the order of their `amount paid`.
* The final amount a `person` ends up paying can be restricted to a `<limit>`.
Persons with limits should be placed at the *head* of the list of persons,
and the order of all `limits` should match the order of `persons` (as with `amount paid`).
This is to allow you to enter limits only for those persons who require them. +
The sum of all limits cannot exceed the total amount already paid by all persons.
* Adding the optional `me/` will add all debts from the resulting list to your loan list.
+
`<your name>` must match one of the persons among the other `p/<person>` names.
* Adding `w/` will set the `<date>` of the loans added to your list.
* Adding `d/` will set the `<description>` of the loans added to your list.
* To switch between your loan list and split list, press `Ctrl + D` (or `Cmd + D` for Mac) while on the Loans tab.
** The split list will initially be empty,
but once a list is calculated it will persist in the Loans tab across sessions (until a new calculation is made).
****

Examples:

* `loan split p/John x/0 p/Mary x/40 p/Peter x/60` +
Calculates the money owed between `John`, `Mary` and `Peter` for a scenario where (initially) `Mary` paid `40` and `Peter` paid `60`. +
The resulting display should show that `John` owes `Mary` *$6.66* and also owes `Peter` *$26.67*.
* `loan split p/John x/0 max/10 p/Mary x/10 p/Peter x/90 me/Mary d/Dinner.` +
In this scenario, `Mary` paid `10` and `Peter` paid `90`.
`max/10` restricts the final amount `John` pays/owes to `10`, despite the total amount being `0 + 10 + 90 = 100`.
Furthermore, `me/Mary` marks `Mary` as the user (you),
so any debts `Mary` owes/is owed will be added to the normal loan list with the description `Dinner.`. +
The resulting display should show that `John` owes `Peter` *$10* and `You` owe `Peter` *$35*.
The latter debt will also have been added to your loan list,
which can be checked using the command `loan list` or by pressing the hotkey mentioned above.
// end::loans[]

// tag::rules[]
=== Automating with rules: `rule`

// TODO: Some information here to show users perspective
*Introducing the _Rule Engine_.*
A way for you to automate certain actions based on a certain predicate.
Spend less time typing repetitive commands, and spend more time keeping track of your expenses!

Rules have the following structure: If "predicate" is true, then perform "action".

All rules in the Rule Engine will be executed on a transaction, when:

* it is a new transaction and has been successfully added into an account.

OR

* it is an existing transaction and has been successfully edited.

WARNING: All rules will be executed from the bottom of the list upwards.
Typically, this is the order in which the rules were added.
Rules with conflicting actions will therefore be allowed.

==== Add a new rule: `rule add`

Adds a new rule to the rule engine.
Both the predicate and action have to be specified.
A rule can be formed using either expressions or scripts, or both.

Format: `rule add pred/<expression | script name> act/<expression | script name>`

Refer to <<Scripting>> for script usage.
****
*Expression Formatting Guide:*

* **Predicate**: In the order of `<attribute> <predicate operator> <value>`
** An attribute can be one of the following:
*** `inamt` : Transaction amount inwards
*** `outamt` : Transaction amount outwards
*** `desc` : Transaction description
*** `date` : Transaction date
** A predicate operator can be one of the following:
*** `=` : Equality comparison operator
*** `<` , `\<=`  , `>=` , `>` : Inequality comparison operators
*** `contains` : Substring check operator (Cannot be used on dates)
** A value can be a number or a string of length not more than 180 characters
It can contain the following special characters: _!#$%&'*+=?`/[{|}]~^.-_

* **Action**: In the order of `<action operator> [<value>]`
** An action operator can be one of the following:
*** `set_cat` : Adds a category to the transaction
*** `remove_cat` : Removes a category from the transaction
*** `set_desc` : Sets the description of the transaction
*** `app_desc` : Appends a value to the description
*** `prep_desc` : Prepends a value to the description
*** `set_in` : Sets the direction of the transaction to be inwards
*** `set_out` : Sets the direction of the transaction to be outwards
*** `switch_direct` : Switches the current direction of the transaction
** A value is as described in a predicate expression,
and is not required for `set_in`, `set_out` and `switch_direct`
****

==== List rules: `rule list`

Displays the list of all existing rules, sorted by the order in which a rule was added.

Format: `rule list`

==== Edit a rule: `rule edit`

Edits the specified fields in the rule with the specified ID.
Both the predicate and action can be modified.

Format: `rule edit <rule ID> [pred/<expression | script>] [act/<expression | script>]`

==== Delete a rule: `rule delete`

Deletes a rule with the specified rule ID.

Format: `rule delete <rule ID>`

==== Swap two rules: `rule swap`

NOTE: Ths will affect the execution order of the rules.
Rules will be executed from the bottom of the list upwards.

Swaps the position of two specified rules in the Rule Engine.

Format: `rule swap <rule 1 ID> <rule 2 ID>

// end::rules[]

// tag::scripting[]
[[Scripting]]
=== Scripting: `script`

The scripting engine allows you to evaluate arbitrary scripts to perform complex operations on your transaction data,
as well as extend the application and add commands and features of your own.

WARNING: Scripts have full access to the application's internals, as well as all Java standard library classes and APIs.
It is possible to corrupt the application state by execution of a malicious or buggy script. There are no guarantees on
application behaviour if scripts are used.

==== Evaluate a script: `script eval`

Evaluates a script and displays the result.

Format: `script eval <script>`

****
* The scripting language is JavaScript (specifically, ECMAScript 5.1).
****

==== Add a stored script: `script add`

Stores a script for future invocation.

Format: `script add <script name> [p/<file path> | s/<script>]`

****
* The script name may contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes.
* If neither a file path nor the script code is given, a file browser is opened for you to
select the script file.
****

WARNING: The script is not checked for correctness before it is stored. Any syntax errors
will be reported only when the script is run.

==== Delete a stored script: `script delete`

Deletes a previously-stored script.

Format: `script delete <script name>`

==== Run a stored script: `script run`

Runs a previously-stored script.

Format: `script run <script name> [<argument>]`

****
* The argument is the rest of the command line after the script name, and is passed to the script as a single string.
****

==== List stored scripts: `script list`

Lists stored scripts.

Format: `script list`

==== Reset the scripting environment: `script reset`

==== Import a file: `import`

Imports transactions from the file at the given path.

Format: `import [f/<format>] [p/<file path>]`
****
* The file path can be relative to where you launched Budget Buddy from, or absolute.
If the path is omitted, a file browser is opened for you to select the file.
* Format is one of dbs (DBS Bank/POSB), ocbc (OCBC Bank), sc (Standard Chartered), csv (generic comma-separated values file).
If the format is omitted, automatic detection is attempted.
****

==== Export transactions: `export`

Exports all transactions to the given path.

Format: `export [p/<file path>]`
****
* The file path can be relative to where you launched Budget Buddy from, or absolute.

****
// end::importexport[]

// tag::aliases[]
=== Aliases *(Coming in v1.4)* : `alias`

==== Add an alias: `alias add`

Adds an alias.

Format: `alias add <alias name> c/<alias replacement>`

****
* When executed, the alias name will be replaced by the replacement, and the resulting command line executed.
** For example, suppose you add an alias named `abcd efgh 7890`, with replacement `script run x`.
** Executing `abcd efgh 7890 abcd` is equivalent to executing `script run x abcd`.
* The alias name must appear at the start of a command line, followed by a space, for it to be recognised.
* There is no restriction on the characters in the alias name. However, leading and trailing whitespace will be trimmed.
* Aliases can expand to other aliases.
****

WARNING: Built-in commands take precedence. If you add an alias with the same name as a built-in command, it will have no effect.
