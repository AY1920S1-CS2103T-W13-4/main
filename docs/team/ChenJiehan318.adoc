== PROJECT: Budget Buddy

---

== Overview

BudgetBuddy is a desktop expense tracker application used for managing expenses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the feature of account and related commands*
** What it does: allows the user to manage their accounts to facilitate the tracking of expenses, including *add/delete/edit/list/find* the accounts.
** Justification: This feature lays the foundation for the product because a user needs accounts to carry out all other activities, e.g. manage the transactions in a particular account.
** Highlights: This feature affects many other existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was demanding as it required carefully design to fit the entire architecture.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the help window that allows the user to navigate to the website when they are in need of help.
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
