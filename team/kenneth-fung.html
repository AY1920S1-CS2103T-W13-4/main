<h2 id="overview"><a class="link" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Budget Buddy is a desktop application that allows users to track their expenses.
The user interacts with it using a Command-Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="about-the-project"><a class="link" href="#about-the-project">About the Project</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Budget Buddy has a number of features to help users track their expenses and deeply customize their experience while using the app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an expense tracker, Budget Buddy provides the ability for users to record and categorize transactions they have made.
Transactions can also be divided into user-created accounts, helping users to isolate transactions for specific events or holidays.
Budget Buddy further allows the user to track loans that they owe others or are owed to them,
helping them remember to pay back or reclaim borrowed money.
Unbalanced group payments can also be split equally by Budget Buddy,
and the resulting debts the user owes or is owed can be recorded as loans automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Budget Buddy also provides features to deeply customize the user experience.
Users can create rules to automate many actions;
for example, they could create a rule that adds a transaction to a specific category if said transaction exceeds a certain amount.
As the target audience comprises of computing students,
Budget Buddy also allows users to utilize their computing know-how to write custom scripts to manipulate the app.
For example, users can write scripts to add huge numbers of transactions,
or scripts to trigger alarms when their expenses have exceeded a certain limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role in the project was to implement all facets regarding the <strong>loans</strong> feature.
Chiefly, I added the ability for the user to add, edit, view and delete loans.
Users can also mark loans as paid or unpaid,
and when viewing their list of loans they can sort or filter the list by amount, date and more.
I was also responsible for implementing the complex algorithm necessary to split and divide an initially unbalanced group payment;
the main challenge in this scenario was to devise an algorithm that worked for any group size and every variation of initial unbalance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside from the implementation of features, I also aided in the delegation of roles among the team,
upholding the quality of project documentation, and ensuring the team remained on task.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added <strong>the ability to track loans and split unbalanced group payments equally</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What they do</strong>: Tracking loans allows the user to track all the money that they owe/are owed to other people.
Splitting group payments through the app allows the user in avoiding messy miscalculations and over/under-paying their friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: This feature improves the product significantly,
as both lending/borrowing money and paying for large items as a group are common occurrences that affect one&#8217;s expenses,
especially for students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: Implementing loan-tracking required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives,
especially regarding the structure of the loan-person relationship.
Building it on top of and mutating the original brownfield project also proved challenging.
Splitting group payments proved difficult due to the need for an accurate yet efficient algorithm.
Great care had to be taken to correctly implement each of the many steps in the complex final result.</p>

<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Loans feature exists outside of the Account/Transaction mechanisms.
It adds a separate <code>LoansManager</code> alongside the main <code>AccountsManager</code>, with <code>Loan</code> objects stored internally in an <code>internalList</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following class diagram demonstrates the association between the <code>LoansManager</code> and <code>Loan</code> objects.
Miscellaneous methods (such as <code>LoansManager#getLoans</code> and <code>LoansManager#getLoansCount</code>) are omitted.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Class Diagram of the Loans Model</div>
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the <code>LoansManager</code> behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1.
The user launches the application.
If <code>loans.json</code> exists on the hard disk, its data is loaded into <code>internalList</code>.
Otherwise, <code>loans.json</code> is created and the <code>LoansManager</code> initializes with an <code>internalList</code> containing a few sample loans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2.
The user executes the command <code>loan out p/John x/4.20 d/Paid for his lunch</code> to add a new loan.
This creates a new loan <code>toAdd</code> of <code>amount</code> 4.20 <code>out</code> to the <code>person</code> John, with the description <code>Paid for his lunch</code>.
Since the user did not provide a date, the current system date is used for the <code>date</code> of <code>toAdd</code>.
<code>LoansManager#addLoan(Loan toAdd)</code> is called and
(after verifying that <code>toAdd</code> does not already exist in <code>internalList</code>)
<code>toAdd</code> is added to <code>internalList</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of adding a loan:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/LoanSequenceDiagram.png" alt="LoanSequenceDiagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for Adding a Loan</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the rest of the operations work using a similar sequence of steps.
Some commands might create a new <code>Loan</code> object (as shown above) while others might just use the <code>Index</code> of a loan (e.g. <code>loan delete</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="multi-loan-targeting"><a class="link" href="#multi-loan-targeting">Multi-Loan Targeting</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user can target and act on multiple loans with a single command.
For example, <code>loan paid 1 3 4</code> can be used to mark the first, third and fourth loans in <code>internalList</code> as <code>PAID</code>.
Alternatively or additionally, <code>loan paid p/John p/Mary</code> can also be used
to mark all the loans of the persons John and Mary in <code>internalList</code>.
The <code>LoansManager</code> handles this by executing the appropriate operation repeatedly.
In the case of <code>loan paid 1 3 4</code>, <code>LoansManager#editLoan</code> is called once for each of the three loans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To account for the fact that the list size might change after each operation,
the size of the list before and after each operation is compared.
If it has changed, the targeted indices are adjusted accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any of the target loan indices cannot be found by the <code>LoansManager</code> in <code>internalList</code>,
they are added to a <code>missingLoanIndices</code> list.
Similarly, target persons that cannot be found are added to a <code>missingPersons</code> list.
Both lists are displayed to the user after other target loans that are in <code>internalList</code> have been acted upon,
notifying the user that the target <code>indices</code>/<code>persons</code> could not be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-loan targeting is implemented for the commands <code>loan paid</code>, <code>loan unpaid</code> and <code>loan delete</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="loan-splitting"><a class="link" href="#loan-splitting">Loan Splitting</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Loan splitting exists as a command that the user can execute.
Its purpose is to split a large, initially unbalanced group payment equally among the group&#8217;s members.
The following example scenario should clarify the purpose of the command:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John, Mary and Peter go out for dinner.
The meal costs $100, so Peter pays $90 and Mary covers the remaining $10.
However, the three want to split the bill equally among themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John executes the command <code>loan split p/John p/Mary p/Peter x/0 x/10 x/90</code>.
Budget Buddy then outputs a list of the necessary payments between the three.
From this list, John can now see that he owes Peter <strong>$33.33</strong> and that Mary owes Peter <strong>$23.33</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example scenario to demonstrate how the final list is calculated.
The algorithm as a whole can be summarized in the activity diagram below,
which might prove helpful for following the steps in the example scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/LoanSplitActivityDiagram.png" alt="LoanSplitActivityDiagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Activity Diagram for Loan Split Algorithm</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1.
The user executes the command <code>loan split p/Ben p/Duke p/Adam p/Zed x/0 x/20 x/80 x/50 max/10 me/Ben d/Dinner</code>.
In this scenario, out of the total bill of <strong>$150</strong>,
<code>Ben</code> has paid <strong>$0</strong>,
<code>Duke</code> has paid <strong>$20</strong>,
<code>Adam</code> has paid <strong>$80</strong>
and <code>Zed</code> has paid <strong>$50</strong>.
Furthermore, <code>max/10</code> specifies that <code>Ben</code> should only pay/owe up to <strong>$10</strong> overall.
Finally, <code>me/Ben</code> marks <code>Ben</code> as the user;
all debts involving <code>Ben</code> should be added to the normal loan list with the description <code>Dinner</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2.
<code>LoanSplitCommandParser</code> parses the persons, amounts, and max shares into <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code>, <code>List&lt;Amount&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;Long&gt;</code> respectively.
<code>me/Ben</code> and <code>d/Dinner</code> are parsed into <code>Optional&lt;Person&gt;</code> and <code>Optional&lt;Description&gt;</code>.
A new <code>LoanSplitCommand</code> is instantiated with the lists and optional objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3.
<code>LoanSplitCommand</code> replaces <code>Ben</code> in <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> with a <code>Person</code> with the <code>Name</code> <code>You</code>.
Using the static methods of a <code>LoanSplitCalculator</code> class, it then begins executing the following algorithm:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <code>defaultSharePerPerson</code> is calculated.
In this scenario, <strong>$150</strong> should be split among the 4 persons.
However, as <code>Ben</code> has a max share of <strong>$10</strong>, the other 3 persons must divide <strong>$140</strong> among themselves,
resulting in a <code>defaultSharePerPerson</code> of <strong>$46.66</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each person in <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> is given a <code>balance</code>,
calculated using the amount they paid initially (from <code>List&lt;Amount&gt;</code>)
minus either the <code>defaultSharePerPerson</code> or their max share if present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of all possible sub-groups (combinations) of persons is generated.
In this scenario, the number of sub-groups for the 4 persons would be <strong>16</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each sub-group, if the sum of their balances is <strong>zero</strong>, then the following steps are performed:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Take the persons with the smallest and biggest balances: the <code>debtor</code> and <code>creditor</code> respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
